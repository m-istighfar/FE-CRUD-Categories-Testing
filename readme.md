## Objective

The main objective of this module is to introduce important React concepts and features, enabling the application of React Lifecycle methods, Hooks, Custom Hooks, Context, and Routing in developing robust applications.

### Learning Outcomes

- Understanding and application of React Lifecycle methods in components.
- Exploration and utilization of React Hooks for state management and other functionalities.
- Creation and implementation of Custom Hooks for reusing functionality across the application.
- Utilization of React Context for global state management.
- Application of React Routing for navigation between different application pages.
- Completion of an assignment to reinforce the learned concepts.

## Deliverables

1. **Create the following three pages:**

   a. **Register**: Users should be able to register via API.
   
   b. **Login**: Implementation of a login page.
   
   c. **Category**: Implement the following functionalities:
      - Viewing the list of categories.
      - Saving a category.
      - Updating a category.
      - Deleting a category.
      - Filtering categories.
      - Prevention of submission of duplicate category names.

2. **Form Validation**: Ensure all category forms have appropriate validation.

3. **Implement Authorization**: Secure the application by implementing proper authorization.

4. **Tech Stack**: Utilize Tailwind for styling, Formik for form handling, Yup for form validation, and Vite as the build tool.
